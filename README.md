# Module 4: Coding Quiz Challenge

While I understood the assignment, I didn't understand the concepts enough so I am totally going to redo this whole thing. Thank you in advance for any comments and criticisms.

## User Story

I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
